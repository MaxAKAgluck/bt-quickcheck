## Quick Start

```bash
# One-liner execution (recommended)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAKAgluck/bt-quickcheck/main/bt-quickcheck.sh)

# Or download and run locally
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAKAgluck/bt-quickcheck/main/bt-quickcheck.sh -o bt-quickcheck.sh
chmod +x bt-quickcheck.sh
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh
```

## Why this exists

I wanted a quick, practical way to baseline a Linux host from a defender’s point of view without hauling in a full-blown auditing suite. This script favors fast, useful signal over exhaustive checks, and tries to point you toward the next best action.

## How this was built

This project was created primarily using the LLM IDE Cursor and the Claude 4 Sonnet thinking model, with additional external research and manual review. Expect some rough edges—suggestions and fixes are very welcome.

## Project status

This is an early, evolving tool. The script is still raw and under development. Output formats and checks may change as things improve. If something feels off, please open an issue or PR.

### Saving Reports to Current Directory

You can save reports directly in the directory where you run the script. Relative paths are allowed and validated safely.

Examples:

```bash
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -m personal --anonymize -o report.json
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -o ./report.html
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -o results/report.txt
```

Allowed locations include your current working directory, your home directory, and standard temporary directories (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`). Paths are canonicalized to prevent traversal attacks.

## Sudo Requirements

### Why Sudo is Recommended

While bt-quickcheck can run without sudo, **comprehensive security assessment requires elevated privileges** to access system files, logs, and configurations that are critical for security analysis.

### Running with Sudo (Recommended)

```bash
# Full security assessment
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh
```

**With sudo, you get access to:**
- **System log analysis** (auth.log, secure, system logs)
- **Password policy audit** (/etc/shadow access)
- **Sudo configuration review** (/etc/sudoers analysis)
- **System service configurations** (detailed service status)
- **Package integrity verification** (rpm -Va, debsums)
- **Advanced file permissions** (system-wide SUID/SGID scans)
- **Process forensics** (network connections, capabilities)
- **Container security** (privileged containers, host mounts)
- **Kernel module analysis** (loaded modules inspection)
- **EDR/monitoring agents** (detailed configuration)

### Running without Sudo (Limited)

```bash
# Limited security assessment
./bt-quickcheck.sh
```

**Without sudo, you only get:**
- **Basic system information** (kernel, distro, uptime)
- **Public network services** (listening ports)
- **User account structure** (UID 0 accounts only)
- **SSH client configuration** (user-accessible settings)
- **Available security tools** (installed packages)
- **User-accessible file permissions** (home directory only)
- **Personal configuration** (shell, environment)

### Console Warning System

When running without sudo, bt-quickcheck will:

1. **Display prominent warnings** at startup explaining limitations
2. **Show which checks are being skipped** and why they require sudo
3. **Provide a detailed summary** of what was checked vs. what was missed
4. **Recommend running with sudo** for comprehensive assessment

### Production vs Personal Mode

- **Production Mode**: Requires sudo for meaningful security assessment and compliance validation
- **Personal Mode**: Can provide basic security insights without sudo, but comprehensive assessment still requires elevated privileges

### Example Output Differences

#### With Sudo:
```
=== Accounts and Sudo === (Full access) [user security]
[OK] Only root has UID 0
[OK] No NOPASSWD sudo entries
[WARN] 3 accounts without passwords detected
```

#### Without Sudo:
```
=== Accounts and Sudo === (Limited - requires sudo) [user security]
[OK] Only root has UID 0
[WARN] NOPASSWD sudo check skipped - requires sudo access
[WARN] Password audit skipped - requires sudo access to /etc/shadow
```

## Operation Modes

### Personal Mode (Default)
```bash
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -m personal
```
- Home/personal machine recommendations
- Security-through-obscurity suggestions
- User-friendly guidance

### Production Mode
```bash
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -m production
```
- Stricter recommendations and severities
- Additional checks enabled (see below)
- Compliance and centralization focus

### Mode Differences (high-level)
- Firewall: production requires host firewall tooling/rules (WARN/CRIT if missing); personal suggests
- Logging: production expects remote forwarding to a central collector; personal optional
- Time sync: production discourages minimal timesyncd, prefers chrony/ntp with multiple sources
- File integrity: production checks for AIDE/Tripwire and recommends automated monitoring
- EDR: production may flag missing EDR as CRIT and expects SIEM/forwarding
- Resource health (production-only): CPU/memory/disk space checks

## Optional: Encrypt your report

bt-quickcheck is dependency-light and does not embed encryption. To encrypt your outputs, use standard tools you already trust:

```bash
# OpenSSL (AES-256-GCM)
openssl enc -aes-256-gcm -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 250000 \
  -in security-report.json -out security-report.json.enc

# GPG symmetric (AES256)
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 security-report.json

# Age (if installed)
age -p -o security-report.json.age security-report.json
```

Recommended: store keys securely, avoid keeping plaintext after verifying the encrypted file, and follow your organization’s data handling standards.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to improve bt-quickcheck! Here's how you can help:

### Reporting Issues
- **Bug Reports**: Use GitHub issues to report bugs with system details
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new security checks or improvements
- **Documentation**: Help improve documentation and examples
- **Security Issues**: Report security vulnerabilities via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting

### Contributing Code
1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Propose new checks** via issues first with:
   - Target Linux distributions
   - Command syntax and expected output
   - Severity justification
   - Security benchmark references (CIS, NIST, etc.)
3. **Follow coding standards**:
   - Read-only operations only
   - Efficient execution (avoid deep recursive scans)
   - Graceful error handling
   - Clear, actionable recommendations
4. **Test thoroughly** across different distributions
5. **Submit a pull request** with detailed description

### Development Guidelines
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add appropriate error handling with timeout protection
- Include both personal and production mode recommendations
- Document new features in README
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Implement enhanced input validation for all new features
- Add comprehensive error logging and system log integration
- Ensure all new checks follow industry security standards

### Security Considerations
- All new checks must be read-only
- No external network connections
- Validate all inputs and file paths
- Include appropriate security disclaimers
- Implement enhanced input validation for all new features
- Add timeout protection to prevent hanging sections
- Include comprehensive error logging and system log integration
- Follow industry security standards (CIS, NIST) for new checks

### Enhanced Error Handling & Timeout Protection

#### Timeout Protection
- **Section Timeout**: 30-second timeout for each security check section
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback for systems without timeout command
- **Hang Prevention**: Prevents sections from blocking execution indefinitely
- **Resource Protection**: Protects against resource exhaustion

#### Enhanced Error Logging
- **Timestamped Errors**: All errors include UTC timestamps
- **System Log Integration**: Errors logged to system logs when running as root
- **Structured Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error categorization and reporting
- **Audit Trail**: Complete error history for compliance and debugging

#### Error Recovery
- **Section Isolation**: Errors in one section don't affect others
- **Graceful Degradation**: Script continues with remaining checks
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages with actionable recommendations
- **Debugging Support**: Detailed error context for troubleshooting
