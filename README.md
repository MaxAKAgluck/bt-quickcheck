## Quick Start

```bash
# One-liner execution (recommended)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAKAgluck/bt-quickcheck/main/bt-quickcheck.sh)

# Or download and run locally
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAKAgluck/bt-quickcheck/main/bt-quickcheck.sh -o bt-quickcheck.sh
chmod +x bt-quickcheck.sh
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh
```

## Why this exists

I wanted a quick, practical way to baseline a Linux host from a defender’s point of view without hauling in a full-blown auditing suite. This script favors fast, useful signal over exhaustive checks, and tries to point you toward the next best action.

## How this was built

This project was created primarily using the LLM IDE Cursor and the Claude 4 Sonnet thinking model, with additional external research and manual review. Expect some rough edges—suggestions and fixes are very welcome.

## Project status

This is an early, evolving tool. The script is still raw and under development. Output formats and checks may change as things improve. If something feels off, please open an issue or PR.

### Saving Reports to Current Directory

You can save reports directly in the directory where you run the script. Relative paths are allowed and validated safely.

Examples:

```bash
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -m personal --anonymize -o report.json
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -o ./report.html
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -o results/report.txt
```

Allowed locations include your current working directory, your home directory, and standard temporary directories (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`). Paths are canonicalized to prevent traversal attacks.

## Sudo Requirements

### Why Sudo is Recommended

While bt-quickcheck can run without sudo, **comprehensive security assessment requires elevated privileges** to access system files, logs, and configurations that are critical for security analysis.

### Running with Sudo (Recommended)

```bash
# Full security assessment
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh
```

**With sudo, you get access to:**
- ✅ **System log analysis** (auth.log, secure, system logs)
- ✅ **Password policy audit** (/etc/shadow access)
- ✅ **Sudo configuration review** (/etc/sudoers analysis)
- ✅ **System service configurations** (detailed service status)
- ✅ **Package integrity verification** (rpm -Va, debsums)
- ✅ **Advanced file permissions** (system-wide SUID/SGID scans)
- ✅ **Process forensics** (network connections, capabilities)
- ✅ **Container security** (privileged containers, host mounts)
- ✅ **Kernel module analysis** (loaded modules inspection)
- ✅ **EDR/monitoring agents** (detailed configuration)

### Running without Sudo (Limited)

```bash
# Limited security assessment
./bt-quickcheck.sh
```

**Without sudo, you only get:**
- ⚠️ **Basic system information** (kernel, distro, uptime)
- ⚠️ **Public network services** (listening ports)
- ⚠️ **User account structure** (UID 0 accounts only)
- ⚠️ **SSH client configuration** (user-accessible settings)
- ⚠️ **Available security tools** (installed packages)
- ⚠️ **User-accessible file permissions** (home directory only)
- ⚠️ **Personal configuration** (shell, environment)

### Console Warning System

When running without sudo, bt-quickcheck will:

1. **Display prominent warnings** at startup explaining limitations
2. **Show which checks are being skipped** and why they require sudo
3. **Provide a detailed summary** of what was checked vs. what was missed
4. **Recommend running with sudo** for comprehensive assessment

### Production vs Personal Mode

- **Production Mode**: Requires sudo for meaningful security assessment and compliance validation
- **Personal Mode**: Can provide basic security insights without sudo, but comprehensive assessment still requires elevated privileges

### Example Output Differences

#### With Sudo:
```
=== Accounts and Sudo === (Full access) [user security]
[OK] Only root has UID 0
[OK] No NOPASSWD sudo entries
[WARN] 3 accounts without passwords detected
```

#### Without Sudo:
```
=== Accounts and Sudo === (Limited - requires sudo) [user security]
[OK] Only root has UID 0
[WARN] NOPASSWD sudo check skipped - requires sudo access
[WARN] Password audit skipped - requires sudo access to /etc/shadow
```

## Operation Modes

### Personal Mode (Default)
```bash
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -m personal
```
- Home/personal machine recommendations
- Security-through-obscurity suggestions
- User-friendly guidance

### Production Mode
```bash
sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh -m production
```
- Stricter recommendations and severities
- Additional checks enabled (see below)
- Compliance and centralization focus

### Mode Differences (high-level)
- Firewall: production requires host firewall tooling/rules (WARN/CRIT if missing); personal suggests
- Logging: production expects remote forwarding to a central collector; personal optional
- Time sync: production discourages minimal timesyncd, prefers chrony/ntp with multiple sources
- File integrity: production checks for AIDE/Tripwire and recommends automated monitoring
- EDR: production may flag missing EDR as CRIT and expects SIEM/forwarding
- Resource health (production-only): CPU/memory/disk space checks


## Security Assessment Categories

### Core Security Checks
- System basics: distro, kernel, uptime, virtualization hints
- Patching: pending updates with mode-specific recommendations
- Network exposure: listening services summary and port analysis
- Firewall: ufw/firewalld/nftables/iptables presence and rules (prod requires)
- SSH hardening: PermitRootLogin, PasswordAuthentication, access controls, port configuration
- Auditing and hardening: auditd, SELinux/AppArmor status with activation guidance

- Logging and monitoring: rsyslog/syslog-ng, log file permissions, logrotate, remote forwarding (prod expects)
- Network security: TCP SYN cookies, excessive open ports, IPv6 status (personal mode)
- Package integrity: RPM/DEB verification (rpm -Va, debsums)
- File integrity: SHA256 hashes; prod checks for AIDE/Tripwire and monitoring
- Persistence mechanisms: cron jobs, timers, startup scripts, shell configs, kernel modules
- Process forensics: process tree analysis, capabilities, temp directory execution
- Secure configuration: kernel hardening flags, umask settings, core dumps, 2FA indicators
- Container security: Docker/Podman/LXC detection, privileged containers, host mounts, Kubernetes
- Kernel hardening: Secure Boot, lockdown mode, module signing, grsecurity, advanced sysctl flags
- Application security: web server TLS, database exposure, SSL/TLS enforcement
- Secrets management: API keys, SSH keys, .env files permissions, agent forwarding detection
- Cloud/remote management: cloud agents, VNC/RDP detection, remote access security
- EDR/monitoring: antivirus/EDR detection, SIEM/forwarding expectations (prod stricter)
- Backup/resilience: tools, snapshots, disaster recovery
- Resource health (production): CPU load, memory usage, disk space thresholds
- Malware detection: Signature-based detection of common malware patterns
- Rootkit detection: Advanced detection of hidden processes and kernel-level threats
- Behavioral analysis: Anomaly detection and risk assessment based on system behavior


Each finding includes:
- Severity level: OK, WARN, CRIT, INFO
- Recommendations tailored to mode (personal vs production)
- Structured output for automation and reporting

## Optional: Encrypt your report

bt-quickcheck is dependency-light and does not embed encryption. To encrypt your outputs, use standard tools you already trust:

```bash
# OpenSSL (AES-256-GCM)
openssl enc -aes-256-gcm -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 250000 \
  -in security-report.json -out security-report.json.enc

# GPG symmetric (AES256)
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 security-report.json

# Age (if installed)
age -p -o security-report.json.age security-report.json
```

Recommended: store keys securely, avoid keeping plaintext after verifying the encrypted file, and follow your organization’s data handling standards.

sudo ./bt-quickcheck.sh
```

**Note:** External config values are sanitized for security and override embedded defaults.

## Enhanced Input Validation & Security Features

### v0.6.3 Security Hardening (Latest)

#### **Critical Vulnerability Fixes**

1. **Configuration Command Injection (CRITICAL)**
   - **Fixed**: All external configuration values are sanitized to remove dangerous shell metacharacters
   - **Protection**: Removed backticks, command substitution `$()`, semicolons, pipes, redirections
   - **Safe Assignment**: Uses `declare -g` instead of unsafe `export` with user-controlled values
   - **Impact**: Prevents arbitrary code execution via malicious configuration files

2. **Temporary File Race Conditions (HIGH)**
   - **Fixed**: Replaced all predictable temp paths with secure `mktemp` calls
   - **Protection**: Random suffixes (XXXXXXXXXX) prevent symlink attacks
   - **Permissions**: Automatic `chmod 600` for log files, `chmod 700` for directories
   - **Impact**: Prevents symlink attacks, information disclosure, privilege escalation

3. **Format String Vulnerability (MEDIUM)**
   - **Fixed**: Replaced `printf "$message" "$result"` with safe string substitution
   - **Protection**: Uses bash parameter expansion `${message//%s/$result}`
   - **Impact**: Prevents DoS and potential information disclosure

4. **Word Splitting & Glob Expansion (MEDIUM)**
   - **Fixed**: All variables in command execution are now properly quoted
   - **Protection**: Replaced `eval echo "~$USER"` with safe `getent passwd` lookup
   - **Impact**: Prevents argument injection and unintended command execution

5. **Log Parsing DoS (LOW-MEDIUM)**
   - **Fixed**: New `safe_log_grep()` function with size and line limits
   - **Protection**: 100MB file size limit, 10,000 line output limit
   - **Smart Handling**: Auto-uses `tail` for large files
   - **Impact**: Prevents resource exhaustion from parsing massive log files

### Advanced command validation
The script includes command validation to prevent execution of dangerous system commands:

```bash
# Dangerous commands are blocked:
rm, dd, mkfs, fdisk, parted, shutdown, reboot, halt, init, telinit

# Safe commands are validated:
ls, cat, grep, awk, sed, stat, systemctl, ps, netstat, ss
```

### Path sanitization
- Path traversal prevention for `../` and similar patterns
- Execution limited to safe system directories
- Absolute path restrictions
- Symlink protection

### File access
- File size limits (default 1MB)
- Permission checks before access
- Location validation for risky directories
- Safe reading with error handling

### Command execution safety
- Command existence and executability checks
- Avoid executing from `/tmp/` or `/dev/shm/`
- Parameter sanitization
- Wrapped execution with error handling

### Additional Security Hardening Features
- Regex-based input validation for safe character sets
- Hardened output path validation with canonicalization
- Combined argument-length limit for command execution safety
- Expanded dangerous command blocklist (interpreters, editors, archive tools), blocking `eval`, `source`, and `bash|sh -c`
- Disabled shell function inheritance and `BASH_ENV` to prevent injection
- Sensitive-data redaction applied to JSON/HTML/TXT outputs
- Secure temp directories via `mktemp -d` with 0700 permissions
- All variables use safe parameter expansion compatible with `set -u` strict mode
